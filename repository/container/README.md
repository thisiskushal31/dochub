# Containerization Deep Dive

Hands-on notes and guides for containerization in general: fundamentals,
OCI images, runtimes, Docker, and Kubernetes. This repo is meant to be a
single place to explore core concepts, commands, patterns, and troubleshooting
tips.

## Structure

- `containerization-basic/` – core concepts, images vs. containers, registry
  basics, networking, and storage fundamentals.
- `docker/` – CLI reference, images, layers, Dockerfiles, Compose, build &
  push workflows, and debugging.
- `kubernetes/` – cluster architecture, manifests, controllers, networking,
  storage, security, and operations playbooks.

## How to use

1. Pick a folder that matches the topic you’re learning.
2. Start with the README for a quick overview, then drill into subtopics.
3. Use the commands and checklists as copy/paste-friendly references.

## Contributing

- Keep examples minimal and reproducible.
- Prefer clear, copyable commands over long prose.
- Add diagrams or links if they clarify tricky concepts.
