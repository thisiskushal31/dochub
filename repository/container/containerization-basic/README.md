# Containerization Basics

- What containers are vs. VMs: isolation, images, layers, runtimes.
- Image lifecycle: build, tag, push, pull; registries and caching.
- Networking fundamentals: ports, bridges, service discovery patterns.
- Storage: bind mounts vs. volumes; persistence patterns and pitfalls.
- Security: least-privilege images, scanning, and minimal base images.

Use this folder to capture fundamentals and quick references before diving
