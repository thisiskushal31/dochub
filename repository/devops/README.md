# DevOps Handbook

Comprehensive DevOps handbook: methodologies, best practices, tooling guides, automation patterns, and real-world implementation notes — from CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code to cloud-native architectures, observability, and security.

## Structure

- `methodologies/` — DevOps culture, practices, workflows, and team collaboration patterns
- `cicd/` — Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines, practices, and tools
- `iac/` — Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, and best practices
- `automation/` — Automation patterns, scripting, orchestration, and workflow automation
- `cloud-native/` — Cloud-native architectures, patterns, and platform engineering
- `observability/` — Monitoring, logging, tracing, alerting, and SLO/SLI management
- `security/` — Security practices, compliance, secrets management, and threat mitigation

## How to use

1. Start with `methodologies/` for DevOps culture and foundational practices
2. Jump into `cicd/` or `iac/` based on your immediate needs
3. Use `automation/` for workflow and orchestration patterns
4. Reference `observability/` and `security/` for production operations
5. Keep checklists and commands handy for day-to-day operations

## Contributing
