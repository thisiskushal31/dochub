# Database Concepts (Cross-Cutting)

- Storage & indexing: row vs columnar, LSM vs B-tree, compression.
- Consistency & replication: quorum, leader/follower, multi-leader, eventual.
- Sharding & partitioning: keys, rebalancing, hotspots, locality.
- Transactions & durability: WAL/redo logs, checkpoints, fsync strategies.
- Backup & restore: full/incremental, PITR, validation, drills.
- Performance: connection management, caching, query planning, latency SLIs.
- Observability: logs, metrics, traces, slow-query analysis.
