# NoSQL Databases

- Models: key-value, document, wide-column, graph, time-series.
- Trade-offs: consistency models, partitioning, replication, durability.
- Querying: primary vs secondary indexes, scans, aggregations.
- Data modeling: denormalization, access-pattern driven schemas.
- Operations: capacity planning, hot partitions, backups, TTL/compaction.
- Performance: caching layers, pagination strategies, workload isolation.
