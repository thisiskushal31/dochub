# Observability

- Signals: logs, metrics, traces; golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation).
- Tracing: spans, context propagation, sampling; find long/slow edges.
- Metrics: RED/USE, SLIs/SLOs, dashboards; histograms for latency.
- Logging: structure, correlation IDs, PII scrubbing, retention.
- When to use: design observability with each component; validate assumptions before go-live.
