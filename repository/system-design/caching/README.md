# Caching

- Layers: client, CDN, edge, service, DB/result caches.
- Patterns: cache-aside, read-through, write-through, write-behind.
- Invalidation: TTL, versioned keys, explicit purge, generational caches.
- Consistency: staleness budgets, negative caching, stampede protection.
- When to use: latency reduction, hotspot protection, cost control.
