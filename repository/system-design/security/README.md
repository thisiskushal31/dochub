# Security

- Authn/authz: OAuth/OIDC, service identity, RBAC/ABAC, least privilege.
- Data protection: TLS everywhere, mTLS for services, encryption at rest, KMS/HSM.
- Secrets: vaults, rotation, short-lived creds, scoped tokens.
- Isolation: tenancy models, network segmentation, sandboxing.
- When to use: choose controls by data sensitivity and threat model.
