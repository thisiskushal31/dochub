# Storage

- SQL vs NoSQL: transactions vs scale, access patterns, schema flexibility.
- Indexing: B-tree vs LSM, covering indexes, secondary indexes, FTS.
- Partitioning & replication: leaders, multi-leader, follower reads.
- Durability: WAL/redo, checkpoints, backups/PITR, verification.
- When to use: OLTP vs OLAP, document vs columnar vs graph, cold vs hot paths.
