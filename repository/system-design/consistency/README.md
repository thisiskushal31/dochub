# Consistency

- CAP/PCP framing: availability vs partition tolerance vs consistency.
- Quorums: read/write quorum math, tunable consistency.
- Idempotency: keys, tokens, dedupe windows, fences.
- Distributed workflows: sagas, compensation, outbox patterns.
- When to use: choose consistency level per operation; mix strong + eventual paths.
