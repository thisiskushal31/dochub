# Patterns

- Load balancing: L4/L7, weighted routing, canary/blue-green.
- Partitioning: sharding, consistent hashing, locality-aware splits.
- CQRS & event sourcing: read/write separation, rebuilding projections.
- Leader election & coordination: leases, fencing tokens, quorum stores.
- Scheduling & jobs: queues, cron, backpressure, rate controls.
