# Performance

- Budgets: latency per hop, tail latency (p99/p999), concurrency limits.
- Controls: rate limiting, token buckets, leaky buckets, prioritization.
- Efficiency: batching, coalescing, connection reuse, compression.
- Hotspots: load distribution, precomputation, async offload.
- When to use: reduce tail latency and protect shared resources.
