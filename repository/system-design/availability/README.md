# Availability

- Redundancy: multi-AZ/region, active-active vs active-passive, quorum.
- Failure handling: health checks, circuit breakers, bulkheads, graceful degradation.
- Recovery: failover plans, RPO/RTO, backups + PITR, game days.
- Traffic controls: load shedding, brownouts, feature flags for risk.
- When to use: align HA patterns to SLO/error budget and blast-radius limits.
