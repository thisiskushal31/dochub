# Routing & Switching

- Routing: static vs dynamic, OSPF/BGP basics, ECMP, convergence.
- BGP specifics: path selection, communities, route filtering, graceful shutdown.
- Switching advanced: STP variants, MLAG/MC-LAG, VXLAN/EVPN basics.
- Resiliency: fast reroute, high availability patterns, failure domains.
- Validation: traceroute, ping, route tables, control-plane vs data-plane checks.
