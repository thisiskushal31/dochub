# Observability

- Signals: metrics, logs, traces; what to collect for networking.
- Packet analysis: tcpdump basics, filters, capture points, PCAP hygiene.
- Flow visibility: NetFlow/sFlow/VPC Flow Logs; cardinality and retention.
- Performance: latency/jitter/loss, SLIs for networking, synthetic checks.
- Incident workflows: baseline comparisons, hop-by-hop validation, rollback plans.
