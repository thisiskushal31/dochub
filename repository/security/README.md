# Security Deep Dive

Cybersecurity as a **program**: AppSec (application security), identity, cloud, SOC (Security Operations Center), GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance), and PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) phases. You can open this repo knowing nothing. You do not have to finish Networks or DevOps first — those homes still own their *slice* (packets, CI gates, HLD).

Named lab software lives in [Tooling](https://github.com/thisiskushal31/Tooling-and-Frameworks-Deep-Dive) (**one product → one folder**; e.g. Nmap under Security/Reconnaissance, n8n under Automation). This repo links installs — it does not duplicate tool trees. Practice only in an isolated lab — never scan the public internet.

New here? Start at [Foundations](./Foundations/README.md) (21 notes, ordered concept → advanced → apply), then [Threats](./Threats/README.md) (threat landscape deep dive: classical Domain 2 + AI-era, with real cases from official reports). Install Nmap first in [Tooling Security / Nmap](https://github.com/thisiskushal31/Tooling-and-Frameworks-Deep-Dive/tree/main/Security/Reconnaissance/Nmap).
