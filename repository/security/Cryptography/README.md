# Cryptography

[← README](../README.md)

Builder-depth cryptography for engineers who **ship systems**: what cryptography provides, how it fails when misused (including OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project) Top 10:2025 **A04 Cryptographic Failures**), how to choose algorithms and modes, hashing / MAC / HKDF, how to generate and manage keys, how to store passwords and data at rest, how TLS (Transport Layer Security) and certificates break in products, applied token/request-signing patterns, cryptographic inventory, and algorithm transition including post-quantum readiness.

Vocabulary first pass: [Foundations/8](../Foundations/8_Cryptographic_Solutions_Literacy.md). Wire / handshake depth: [Networks-Deep-Dive Security](https://github.com/thisiskushal31/Networks-Deep-Dive). Architecture trade-offs (perf vs crypto): [System-Design Security-Tradeoffs](https://github.com/thisiskushal31/System-Design-Concepts/tree/main/Security-Tradeoffs). App control placement: [AppSec](../AppSec/README.md) (A04 points here). Cloud KMS product paths: [Cloud-Security](../Cloud-Security/README.md) · [DevOps-Handbook Cloud](https://github.com/thisiskushal31/DevOps-Handbook/tree/main/Cloud).

This folder is **not** a number-theory course. Prefer platform libraries and managed services; do not invent protocols. Short forms stay short after the first explanation in each note.

Each note follows **concept → advanced → apply**. Official Further reading only. Lab/adversarial work stays **authorized and isolated** — [Foundations/3](../Foundations/3_Ethics_Authorization_And_Lab_Rules.md).

## Learning path

Recommended: `1 → 2 → 10 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 11 → 9` (file numbers stay as labeled).

Skip ahead only if you already use authenticated encryption and managed keys daily — still read **1** and **5** before production decisions.
